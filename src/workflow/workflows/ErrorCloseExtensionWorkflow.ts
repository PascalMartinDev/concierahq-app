/**
 * DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION
 * =======================
 * 
 * ErrorCloseExtensionWorkflow - Emergency Extension Shutdown
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Provides a fail-safe mechanism for forcefully closing the wine retail POS extension
 * when critical errors occur or normal shutdown procedures fail. Acts as a last resort
 * to prevent the extension from hanging or blocking POS operations.
 * 
 * Execution Flow:
 * 1. Attempts to get global workflow context
 * 2. If context available: Clears all workflow state
 * 3. Forces extension closure via pos_close()
 * 4. No error handling - designed to execute regardless of state
 * 
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - Minimal dependencies to ensure maximum reliability
 * - No error handling to prevent cascading failures
 * - Direct POS integration call without safety wrappers
 * - Simple, linear execution with no branching logic
 * - Operates independently of other workflow states
 * 
 * Emergency Shutdown Strategy:
 * - Clears workflow context if available (graceful cleanup)
 * - Continues execution even if context unavailable (fail-safe)
 * - Forces pos_close() regardless of previous operations
 * - No validation or error reporting to avoid blocking
 * 
 * Usage Scenarios:
 * - Critical system errors that prevent normal shutdown
 * - Workflow context corruption or unavailability
 * - Database connection failures during closure
 * - POS integration errors during normal operations
 * - User-triggered emergency close actions
 * - Timeout scenarios where normal workflows hang
 * 
 * Business Context:
 * Critical for wine retail POS reliability:
 * - Prevents extension from blocking POS terminal
 * - Ensures POS system remains operational after errors
 * - Provides recovery mechanism for stuck workflows
 * - Maintains system stability during critical failures
 * - Enables rapid recovery from error states
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - getGlobalWorkflowContext(): Attempts graceful context cleanup
 * - workflowContext.clearAll(): Resets all workflow states
 * - pos_close(): Native K-series POS function for extension closure
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Simplicity over sophistication for maximum reliability
 * - No dependencies on complex error handling mechanisms
 * - Direct execution path with minimal branching
 * - Fail-safe operation that works even with corrupted state
 * - No logging or debugging to avoid additional failure points
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Intentionally NO error handling to prevent blocking
 * - Silent failures are acceptable for emergency shutdown
 * - No validation of workflow context state
 * - No verification of pos_close() success
 * - Designed to complete execution regardless of errors
 * 
 * Usage:
 * Should only be used in emergency scenarios:
 * ```typescript
 * // Emergency shutdown when normal workflows fail
 * const emergencyWorkflow = new ErrorCloseExtensionWorkflow();
 * await emergencyWorkflow.execute();
 * ```
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - IWorkflow: Standard workflow interface (minimal coupling)
 * - getGlobalWorkflowContext(): Optional context access
 * - pos_close(): Native POS function for extension closure
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Class name has typo: "ErrorClossExtensionWorkflow" (should be "ErrorCloseExtensionWorkflow")
 * - Designed as last resort when normal CloseExtensionWorkflow fails
 * - No debug logging to avoid dependencies on external systems
 * - Minimal code footprint reduces potential failure points
 * - Should not be used for routine extension closure
 * - Consider this workflow as a "circuit breaker" for the system
